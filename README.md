This repository contains files for predicting total_cashflow_input, total_cashflow_output, and the credit_score of 2500+ customers based on loaning data and demographic data as provided by a local Philippine bank that wishes to remain undisclosed. The single-digit prefixes before each file name indicate the order in which the .py files are to be run, and the corresponding step in which the .csv was created.

Modifications may be done in the following areas: scoring values, error metrics, imputations, grid values to name a few. The data_v2_LESS_IMAGES.csv dataset from Step 1 cannot be uploaded publicly due to data privacy concerns.
